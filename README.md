# Flutter Surface Whiteboard

This repository contains a minimal Flutter project demonstrating how to use an
Android `SurfaceView` for a simple whiteboard. It supports drawing and erasing
strokes by leveraging native Android rendering for better performance.

## Building

This project was created manually without the `flutter` command line tools. To
build and run it, ensure you have Flutter installed locally and run:

```bash
flutter run
```

The whiteboard rendering logic is implemented in Android native code. iOS is not
supported.
